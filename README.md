# Customer Labs application task

This project is for an assignment for Customer Labs. This is my attempt to fulfil the requirements of the task as I understood them, and made it as simple as possible, as I believe unless necessary, the solution must be simple. This app is deployed [here](https://customer-labs-assignment.netlify.app/). Hope you like it, and I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

## Tech used:

- Framework: React.js
- CSS Framework: TailwindCSS
- Component Library: AntDesign
- Classnames library for simplifying and clarifying some CSS


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
